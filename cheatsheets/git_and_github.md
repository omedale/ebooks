# Git & GitHub - Use GitHub to manage code and collaborate

## GIT and GITHUB

Before version-control, every time we saved changes to the files/folders we worked on, they were overwritten. If two people were working on the same file LOCALLY (read: on their own machine) and pushed their own version of the modified file to the server, the person pushing its version last would overwrite their colleague's work & they would end up with a conflict. Git and Github allow you to avoid this situation.

[Github](http://byte.kde.org/~zrusin/git/git-cheat-sheet-medium.png) is a versioning system which will take a snapshot of your code as its stands currently. This allows you to rollback to previous versions, branch to make changes, which will not affect your current version and work collaboratively with other developers without conflicting with each others code.

Rather than storing your entire file each time you commit to git, Git will create diff files. These files will just store the changes between each commit. Red are lines which have been removed, green have been added.

As github versioning is distributed, users are able to have multiple copies of the code stored locally. When edited, changes will not be reflected on others local machines.


### Git lifecycle
1. Add the file (git add)
2. Edit the file
3. Stage the file (git commit)
4. Commit: now that we've committed the change, the file is considered as "unmodified" (the current version is the updated, yet untouched version you were working on)
5. Remove the file

### Creating your SSH Key

We did this during the Installfest.

1. `$ cd ~/.ssh`
if it doesn't exist, `$ mkdir ~/.ssh` and go in that folder
2. ` $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email"` (the email you registered to Github with)
3. Ignore the returned passphrase message, or set it to something simple and easily rememberable (e.g. your computer password). When typing it, nothing will show. That's normal.
4. `$ pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub `- will copy your key to your clipboard
5. From here we can go into our github settings/ssh keys â†’  (top right)
6. Add ssh-key and name it
7. In the key text area | cmd + v |
8. Press return and then enter your password
9. Check that it works in terminal:
  * enter `$ ssh -T git@github.com`
  * enter password
  * Done - Github is now fully operational on your machine!

10. Let's now save your github username/email on your computer:
  * `$ git config --global user.name "your github username"` will set your github username on your computer
  * `$ git config --global user.email "your github email"` will set your github email on your computer

### Getting started with Git


`$ git init ` will initialize a git repository in your current directory

After making changes to your repository, you will need to tell git

`$ git add <file name>`  will add your changes for this file to the stage.

`$ git add .`   will add your changes from the whole directory to the stage.

`$ git status  ` will tell us what we currently have staged in the repo

`$ git commit -am "Initial commit" `  will make our first git commit. The "-am" part is a shortcut to add ALL the files at the same time and commit them. We change the message to reflect our changes.

`$ git commit -m "Accurate description of the changes we've made to the repo"  ` commits a snapshot of the current version of the file, with the appropriate description of the changes

`$ git rm  ` unstaging/removing file from git

**Special case: **  
If we end up in VIM!!!! type your commit message in the main body area. From here press esc, esc, esc, until we are off the main body area and then `:wq` (colon is a command, w stands for write, and q for quit). If we do not want to save our changes, we use esc, esc, esc, until we are off the main body area and then `:q!`

If we now repeat git status, we will see our changes are clean.

`$ git log`  will give us a history of our commits  (q to quit the git log) , including the commit IDs

`$ git remote -v  ` will return our remote versions

`$ git log --oneline ` will give us a simpler version of git log

`$ git config list ` will return  your settings

`$ git config --global user.name "your name" ` will set your name

`$ git config --global user.email "your email"`  will set your email


### Rolling back changes

**After staging:**

`$ git reset <filename>  ` will unstage files changes (HEAD refers to our last commit on current branch)

`$ git checkout <filename> `  will then remove these changes

**After committing:**
`$ git reset --soft <commit ID> ` will revert back after changes have been committed. --soft will keep these changes.
`$ git reset --hard <commit ID> ` will revert back after changes have been committed. --hard will destroy these changes.

### Creating a new Repo from GitHub

We can create a new repository in git by selecting the new git repo button on the top right of github.com look for this icon: (top right)

Once created, we can copy the SSH address provided on the repository landing page.

![quick setup git](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/U6fFQCNR5PBAoBe7eZPvGWnDhLdu704oeNNYlFq-7flRtW2v9B0uSI1wiN3Syn8lqDpKAiAnslwCNum03j39KOWhiO1ofhkK4FEjai1y8vLZ6oLpSecTRDnEJw)


We can now return to our terminal and create a the repository on our local machine
`$ git remote add origin <SSH address>`
`$ git push -u origin master  ` if we use -u, we are setting the upstream and will not need to enter origin(remote repo name) master(local branch name) next time we push to this directory. We can simply use  `$ git push`

If we now return to our github repository, all the files which we have just committed should be available in the remote repo.


### Branching

Branching allows you to make different versions of your code that will be stored separately from your master copy. This will allow you to implement a feature nondestructively, which can later be merged into you main branch. This also allows you to push changes to GitHub, without affecting other collaborators on the master branch.

`$ git branch <branch name>`   will create a new branch  
`$ git checkout <branch name> `  will move you to this branch  
`$ git checkout -b <branch name> `  will create and move us to our branch  
`$ git checkout master `  will move us back to our master branch  
`$ git push origin <branch name> ` will push our branch up to gitHub.  
`$ git merge <branch name> `will merge the <branch name> branch onto the branch you're currently on (or onto master, if you're on master)
