#How To Google Like A SmartyPants

Here are some things to keep in mind as you search:

##Composing Your Search String

####Drop Your Baggage

Skip words like "how to" and "how do I" in your search. They're not helping you narrow things down.

####Framework (or Language) First

You don't want .NET answers popping up when you're trying to solve a Rails problem. Get more answers that are in the right ballpark by starting your search with the framework/language you're using.

Be careful about versioning! Including ```Rails 4``` in your search will usually help, but make sure to check the date and look for version hints in tags/content.

####Use " " Effectively

Keeping strings out of quotation marks makes for more flexible searches, but sometimes you want to group terms together. 

Error messages should always be in " " -- many of them contain terms that would otherwise dilute a search string, and the order of terms in an error message is important.



####Keep Things Generic

Don't throw unnecessary or app-specific terms into your search. Your app may be about a bakery, and you might have a Cake model, but there's not going to be a lot of help available for a search string like ```rails uninitialized constant CakesController```. Try removing keywords that won't exist in other apps; something like ```rails uninitialized constant controller``` will yield more accurate results.

####Switch It Up

Don't be afraid to search multiple times, with variations on your search strings. Different articles, documents, and Stack Overflow questions use different phrasing, and you may add or remove a keyword to get closer to what you want.

##Vetting Resources For Quality

####Check The Version

If a post or answer is tagged with an older version, it's important to note that some features may have been changed/deprecated.

####Check The Date

Sometimes, older content won't be problematic, but it's important to pay close attention to the post date of an article/answer. If a newer version of your language/framework/library/tool has come out since the resource was posted, there may be inconsistencies. (Rails answers from 2012 or earlier are likely for an earlier version, and some features may have changed)

####Read It!

It sounds obvious, but reading articles, posts, and answers in their entirety can help you determine if they're useful for your current problem. Scanning a resource for code samples might save you a little bit of time, but context is more valuable in the long run.

If the resource you're looking at doesn't address the issue you're having, keep looking.

####Read The Comments/Note Feedback

Hooray! There's an answer on Stack Overflow! DONE.

Just kidding. 

Before you decide that a solution is viable, take a look at how others in the community have responded to it. Is it getting a lot of upvotes on Stack Overflow? Are all of the comments along the lines of "thanks, that worked!" ? If not, you may need to be wary of the quality of the response. 

Crowdsourced answers and public information aren't infallible, and sometimes they're wrong. Reading comments and feedback can save you time and headaches.

####Interpret Similar Solutions

Sometimes, you won't find a direct solution to your exact problem. Maybe you're trying a unique approach, or someone hasn't written publicly about the problem you're trying to solve. If you find something contextually similar, you may be able to extend and interpret that solution to meet your needs.


##Applying Solutions

####Commit Before You Try Something

You're already committing and pushing super-frequently, right? Just in case, before you try a solution, commit your code. It'll make things easier to revert in the case that you mess something up.

####Think Before You CopyPasta

Before you copy a code snippet from an article, answer, or blog post, make sure that you understand why you're grabbing that snippet. Arbitrarily pasting solutions into your code can be dangerous, and if you don't know why something is going into your code, your chances of understanding why it breaks later are going to be slim.

####Give It Back

Help others! If you've been struggling with something, chances are good that someone else has, too.
